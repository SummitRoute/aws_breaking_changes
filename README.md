# AWS breaking changes and price increases
[![feed](https://github.com/SummitRoute/aws_breaking_changes/raw/main/screenshots/feed_icon.png) Atom feed](https://github.com/SummitRoute/aws_breaking_changes/releases.atom)

This list serves to document the fairly rare changes that break applications or raise prices on AWS or where AWS has shutdown a service.

My goal is to only document issues that would break people's existing applications. So if you have a running app on AWS that makes use of some AWS API calls, what are changes AWS is making that require you to change your code, reconfigure, rebuild, or redeploy your application? Can it live forever as long as your credit card works, or is AWS potentially breaking something?

Any change has the potential to break something somewhere ([xkcd.com/1172/](https://xkcd.com/1172/)), but these seem like the more impactful changes for those that use the impacted service.  These items will stay in this list until about a month after they have gone into effect, at which point they'll be moved to the [archive](archive.md).

This list will also keep track of increases in prices.  This will not track changes in pricing models.

## Services that are deprecated without dates for degradation:
- Cognito Sync: Documentation advises not to use it. ([link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-sync.html)


## AWS support calendars for third-party products

Services such as Lambda and RDS provide managed hosting for third-party products that have their own lifecycle.

AWS already publishes the support calendar for those products.

If you use one of these services and need to know when AWS will stop supporting your current version you can consult its calendar directly.
